# DDoS-Detection
A Python program for DDoS detection using SVM, Naïve Bayes, Random forest and K-NN
This project contains an DDoS detection schemes using various algorithms and a dataset of network logs containing various packet information from past DDoS attacks
Four algorithms are being tested using the dataset these are SVM, K-NN, Random Forest, Naïve bayes. These algorithms are being implemented using ma-chine learning and
python. The dataset which is in arff extension file is being used to train the algo-rithms and the attributes are being provided in a col-umn separately in order to 
create data frames which can be used to act as identifiers in order to check the trained data against the test data.

the dataset can be found at kaggle.com and is uploaded there by JACOB VAN STEYN and he is the creater of the dataset used
